### Currently planned system
In the style of Cyberpunk 2077, all skills can be unlocked and active at once. Each skill tree (Combat, Signs, Alchemy and General) has its own pool of skill points and those points are acquired by performing actions related to those trees e.g. performing attacks/dodges contribute to the Combat tree while casting signs contribute to the Signs tree

### Alternative system
In the style of W1, perk points are split into 3 different types: Bronze, silver and gold. These points are then invested into the progression of a skills tier meaning e.g. for a 5 tier skill: Tier 1+2 is bronze, tier 3+4 is silver and tier 5 is gold
 - 1 bronze point is acquired every time you level up
 - 1 silver point is acquired every time you complete a main story quest
 - 1 gold point is acquired every time you reach a level milestone e.g. 5, 10, etc.
To balance the rate of point acquisiton, the exp gain will follow a logarithmic scaling which:
 - provides lots of bronze points in early game
 - provides some (but not all) gold points in early game
 - increase in rarity on the points in towards mid game
 - no increase in rarity from mid to end-game

The skill slots though will still have a purpose in the form of mutagens. Mutagens can be places in each skill slot and can contribute buffs to Geralt. The normal mutagen slots are for craftable Archmutagens, if the equipped mutagens match the family that the archmutagen is from when equipped it will buff those mutagens while also providing its own strong buffs

Mutations will serve as a means to improve the synergy between your sword, alchemy and sign skills meaning you can effectively combine them to create incredibly powerful moves
