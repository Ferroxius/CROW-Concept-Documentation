Levels are significantly less important now in determining how strong or weak Geralt is. Using a scaling mod, Geralts gear and stats scale up or down to an enemy making the challenge always consistent. This means you can go anywhere and do anything you wish without being level gated
This will mean that the level indicator in your menus does not serve much purpose outside of a visual indication of your progression throughout the game

Weight is changed to no longer be an accumulation of all the items Geralt carries but rather an accumulation of the gear currently equipped on Geralt, similar in style to the soulsbourne series. This eliminates the need for inventory management and instead you only need to consider what Geralt should be equipped with

Roach does not get startled at slight bumps and bridges

Durability will remain as normal but with some changes:
Items can still be repaired with kits, makes it handy to repair on the move
Items can also be repaired at workbenches and grindstones completely free of charge
Items that are repaired at the blacksmith now have a durability boost added (The same as the ones normally from the workbench/grindstone), This gives you a reward for paying a premium
