# CROW-Concept-Documentation
This repository serves as a collective idea centre for all ideas, concepts and suggestions for the CROW overhaul project

The CROW project for those unfamilliar is a proposed overhaul of The Witcher 3 that aims to provide new more in-depth systems for the game while retaining the game's more simplistic style

Inspiration is being drawn from classic RPG games like Guild Wars 2 as well as various other action games and even some other overhaul mods for Witcher 3 like Enhanced Edition

Anyone can contribute to this concept through making a push request to a relevant file in the repository. If you have ideas or thoughts about this concept then do share them

If you want to discuss the project more directly then I suggest you discuss it with me or Aeltoth on the Wolven Workshop discord server (Link: https://discord.gg/NdZEAdgx)

### Release data
We have no ETA on when this mod will come to fruition. The current plan is to wait for the Next Gen Update to arrive and then wait for the updated wolvenkit to arrive. How long that then takes to create the mod will be dependant on how many contributions we have as well as how long it will take for dependency mods to update
